MVC wardrobe project.
This project is made so that a person can create articles of clothing and add them to a database.  The articles can be brought together in the outfit files to creeate an outfit.  
The project uses 5 tables 1 each for each article (Accessories, Bottoms, Tops, Shoes, Outfits) to create the program.  Each of the parts have an Index, Delete, Edit, and Create.  The picture is saved in the database as a string pointing to the location of the picture in the program.  The Outfit is the part of the program that takes each of the other articles and brings them together.  The create and edit works slightly different, instead of being mainly textboxes it uses dropdowns to get the information from the other datatables.
The remaining 4 parts of the database program use textboxes to get the information,  users can put what they want into the textboxes.   The last part is the Home Directory, which just gives basic information.  The navbar can get you to each of the different parts.
